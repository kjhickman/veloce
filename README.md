## üîç Overview

Veloce aims to be a modern, high-performance chess engine implemented in C#. The engine is compatible with the Universal Chess Interface (UCI) protocol, allowing it to be used with most chess GUIs. Its core chess engine will eventually be available as a NuGet package for use in your .NET projects!

## ‚ú® Features

- **Bitboard Representation**: Efficient board state management using 64-bit bitboards
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: Enhanced search algorithm with alpha-beta pruning
- **Transposition Tables**: Optimize search with cached positions
- **Move Ordering**: Basic ordering of moves to improve pruning efficiency
- **UCI Protocol Support**: Compatible with chess GUI applications
- **Perft Testing**: Comprehensive performance testing for move generation
- **Zobrist Hashing**: Fast position hashing for repetition detection
- **Legal Move Generation**: 100% accurate move generation, proven by extensive perft test suite
- **Evaluation**: Basic positional and material evaluation
- **Native AOT Compatible**: The core engine library is fully Native AOT compatible

## üöÄ Performance

Veloce is designed with performance as a priority:

- Fast move generation
- Efficient search algorithm with transposition table support
- Optimized bitboard operations for move generation and evaluation
- Low memory footprint with compact state representation

## üíª Requirements

- .NET 8.0 SDK or later
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Building from Source

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/veloce.git
   cd veloce
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build -c Release
   ```

3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   dotnet test
   ```

## üéÆ Usage

### UCI Interface

TODO: instructions on publishing binary

### As a Library

You can also use Veloce as a library in your own C# projects (.NET 8 and above):

```csharp
using Veloce;
using Veloce.Models;

// Create a new engine
var engine = new Engine();

// Set up a position (default is the starting position)
var position = new Position();
engine.SetPosition(position);

// Find the best move
var bestMove = engine.FindBestMove();

// Make the move
if (bestMove.HasValue)
{
    engine.MakeMove(bestMove.Value);
}
```

### Custom Search Depth

```csharp
// Create engine with custom settings
var settings = new EngineSettings 
{
    Depth = 8,        // Search depth
    HashSizeInMb = 64  // Transposition table size
};
var engine = new Engine(new ConsoleEngineLogger(), settings);

// Find best move with specific depth
var result = engine.FindBestMove();
```

### Perft Testing

You can run performance tests to verify move generation:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/Veloce.Perft/Veloce.Perft.csproj 5 "rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1"
```

The command above runs a PERFT test at depth 5 from the starting position.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The solution is organized into several projects:

- **Veloce**: Core engine library with move generation, evaluation, and search
- **Veloce.Uci**: UCI protocol implementation
- **Veloce.Uci.Lib**: Shared UCI utilities
- **Veloce.Perft**: Performance/correctness testing tool
- **Veloce.SelfPlay**: Temporary self-play testing application
- **Veloce.Tests**: Unit and integration tests
- **Veloce.Benchmarks**: Performance benchmarks

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

Future development plans include:

- [ ] Improved evaluation function with more chess knowledge
- [ ] Quiescence search to handle the horizon effect
- [ ] Better move ordering with history heuristics and killer moves
- [ ] Advanced pruning techniques (null move, futility, late move, delta)
- [ ] Parallel search capabilities
- [ ] Opening book support
- [ ] Endgame tablebase integration
- [ ] Time management for tournament play
- [ ] Pondering (thinking on opponent's time)
- [ ] Multi-variant support (Chess960, etc.)
- [ ] NNUE (Efficiently Updatable Neural Network) evaluation
- [ ] Engine vs. engine match testing
